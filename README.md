# About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project makes use of the Photo API. This API contains selfies of people. Attributes can be requested such as gender, race, age, etc.

This application is a random photo generator where users can tweak attributes to generate photos they want.
